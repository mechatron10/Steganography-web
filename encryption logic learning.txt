1 The middlewares are the logic that are executed whenever the user reaches to a specified route for which it is defined 
2 The middlewares can manipulate the req and the res objects.


3 Use of the multer---The multer module is used to handle the form-data that is recieved upon the post request and then we can manipulate the data recieved from the form.

4 app.post('/encode', upload.array('files', 2), function (req, res, next) { ... }:

app.post('/encode', ...) defines an HTTP POST route with the path '/encode'.
upload.array('files', 2) is a middleware function that processes the file uploads and stores them temporarily in the 'uploads/' directory using multer.
The function (req, res, next) { ... } is the callback function that will be executed when a POST request is made to '/encode'. This function will handle the uploaded files and send a response back to the client.
var multer = require('multer');:

require('multer') imports the multer module, which is a middleware for handling multipart/form-data.
var upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });:

multer({ dest: 'uploads/' }) creates a multer middleware instance, specifying the destination directory where the uploaded files will be temporarily stored. In this case, the files will be stored in the 'uploads/' directory.
